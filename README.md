# Links for Laravel

Laravel's routing system is great. With this package, it will become even greater! Using a simple link reference syntax, you'll be able to store and parse URLs on-the-fly and take full advantage of Laravel's routing in rich content and other stored data structures.

Building a content page and want to add the possibility to insert links to your application's resources (or even external!) from your admin panel? You basically have two options:

1. Store the full URL as a string and hope it won't change soon:
    ```
    Hi! What can I get you? We have some great [apples](https://my-application.test/store/food/fruit/organic-apples).
    Love this package? Support us and consider [sponsoring Whitecube](https://github.com/sponsors/whitecube)!
    ```
2. Store a short, immutable reference to this URL and let your application resolve its current, working URL at runtime:
    ```
    Hi! What can I get you? We have some great [apples](#link[products.item@216]).
    Love this package? Support us and consider [sponsoring Whitecube](#link[sponsor])!
    ```

You'll get it: the second one is probably the best. However, it can swiftly become quite complex to setup and maintain. That's why we've built a package for it.

## Installation

```bash
composer require whitecube/laravel-links
```

This package will auto-register its service provider.

## Usage

First, you'll need to register the application's link resolvers. Link resolvers are objects used to transform immutable link references (such as `products.item@216`) into fully qualified URLs. Resolvers can handle any of your application's routes or even complex external URLs. This package ships with a few common resolvers but feel free to create your own!

A good place to start is with a Service Provider. You can use an existing one (why not the application's `RouteServiceProvider`?) or create a dedicated Provider (e.g. `LinkServiceProvider`). Then, inside the provider's `boot` method, provide a resolver definition for each link you'll need to reference:

```php
use App\Models\Product;
use Whitecube\Links\Facades\Links;

public function boot()
{
    // Simple routes:
    Links::route('home');
    Links::route('about')->title('About us');
    Links::route(name: 'catalog', parameters: ['list' => 'bestselling'])->title('Popular products');

    // Group resources as an "archive":
    Links::archive('products')
        ->index(fn($link) => $link->route('products')->title('All products'))
        ->items(fn($link) => $link->route('product')
            ->model(Product::class)
            ->title(fn($product) => $product->name)
        );
}
```

You can now start [inserting link references](#editing-storing-link-references) and [resolving](#resolving-link-urls) them for display.

## Editing & storing link references

WIP.

## Resolving link URLs

As stated above, links can be stored in many ways, depending on your use case. Here are a few common methods that should get you started.

### Using the `Link` instantiation methods

WIP

### Using the `Links` facade

WIP

### Using the `Str` facade or `str()` helper

WIP

### Using Blade directives

WIP

### Using model attribute casting

Beware that model attribute casting can have undesired side-effects on dedicated link editor components since they'll probably rely on the attribute's raw value (meaning "with unresolved link references") to work.

#### Casting textual content with inline link references (inline tags)

The `ResolvedInlineLinkTagsString` cast is useful when a model has attributes containing editorial content with inline link references (also called "inline tags") that all need to be resolved at once.

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Whitecube\Links\Casts\ResolvedInlineLinkTagsString;

class Post extends Model
{
    protected $casts = [
        'content' => ResolvedInlineLinkTagsString::class,
    ];
}
```

## Reporting link resolving issues

## Development Roadmap

Links are at the base of the world wide web. This package aims to "objectify" and take inventory of a project's internal URLs, which opens a lot of possibilites for future features and updates.

- [x] List available link resolvers ;
- [x] Generate URLs from link references/objects ;
- [x] Generate full list of available concrete links for selectors & specialized form UI components ;
- [ ] Replace inline link references with their resolved URL value ;
- [ ] Generate URLs with `@link()` blade directive ;
- [ ] Define link resolvers directly on Laravel's routes ;
- [ ] Cast Link objects in models ;
- [ ] Report unresolvable link references ;
- [ ] Generate XML sitemaps based on the links inventory ;
- [ ] Reverse-engineer URLs to detailed Link objects ;

Need some of the unchecked features above? Or want to add items to this list? Open an issue or a PR and we'll take a look at it! But remember, if you want professional support, don't forget to sponsor us! ü§ó
